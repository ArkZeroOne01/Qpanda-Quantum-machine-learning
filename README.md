# Qpanda/Qiskit-Quantum-machine-learning
This repository documents the progress of my daily learning outcomes in quantum machine learning. It encompasses the replication and improvement of various algorithms and interfaces mentioned across different papers and platforms, with a primary focus on using the Qpanda framework and Qiskit. Quantum machine learning is facilitated through the Vqnet framework. Currently, the main area of exploration is hybrid quantum-classical neural networks. Future updates will delve into broader areas of quantum computing, such as quantum algorithms and quantum finance.
