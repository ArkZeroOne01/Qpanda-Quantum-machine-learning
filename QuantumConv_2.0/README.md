# Application and optimization of Quanvolution
Here, we construct a hybrid quantum-classical neural network by replacing the convolutional kernels in the neural network with variational quantum circuits. The optimization of the network considers various factors, including parameter space, runtime, and accuracy. The MNIST dataset is used for image classification tasks involving handwritten digit recognition.
